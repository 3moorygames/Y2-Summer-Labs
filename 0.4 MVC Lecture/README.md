## Objective: 
In this lab, you will implement the MVC map, trying to *grasp* the **concept of MVC** as much as possible before moving on to **Flask**!

## Instructions:

1. Pair up with a partner, and draw the layout of an **MVC Map**!
    - It can be done using a paper and pen.  

</br>  

2. After drawing the **MVC Map**, add description of each box/station/map point.
    - For example: Controller -> Controls the application, updates views...etc.  
</br>  

3. Draw the restaurant example experience using an MVC map!  

##### Great job!

## Bonus tasks!

4. Discussion question: 

    (a) What are some advantages of MVC? 
    
    (b) What are some disadvantages of MVC? 
    
5. Put on your MVC glasses: Can you come up with other MVC examples? Which parts correspond to which letter? (Crazier examples are better; you can analyze pretty much anything with the MVC mindset!!)
