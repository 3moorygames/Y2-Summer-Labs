**First things first, *fork* this repo(sitory) and *clone* it to your desktop!**

## HTML Section
1. Create a file "hello.html".<br/> Open the 'hello.html' file using a browser (Like Chrome/Firefox), the page should be empty.<br/><br/> 
2. Make your page stand out!<br/> To do that change it to be about a topic that you’re interested in,<br/> your page should have the following (doesn’t have to be in order):<br/>
> -- Add/change the title of your page <br/> -- A body tag <br/> -- A paragraph inside the body <br/> -- An h1 tag inside the body <br/> -- An h2 tag inside the body.<br/><br/>


3. Add an image.<br/> In the same hello.html file, add an image related to the topic you wrote about. **Set the width to 400px**.<br/><br/>
4. Add a link.<br/>
Add a link to the Wikipedia page about the animal or the topic you're interested in.
<br/><br/>

## CSS Section

1. Use the Tag selector to change the background of your HTML page to your favorite color.<br/>
2. Use an ID selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.<br/>
A property could be: font-size, border, color, etc...<br/>

3. Use a class selector to set a CSS property of one element on your page.<br/>
