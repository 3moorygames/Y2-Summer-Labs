## Instructions:

1. Pair up with a partner, and layout the drawing of an **MVC Map**!
    - It can be done using a paper and pen.
    
2. After drawing the **MVC Map**, add description of each box/station/map point.
    - For example: Controller -> Controls the application, updates views...etc.

3. Draw the restaurant example experience using an MVC map!

##### Great job!
##### Call an Instructor/TA to check your completed tasks
