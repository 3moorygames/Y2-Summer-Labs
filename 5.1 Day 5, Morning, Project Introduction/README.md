# Project Document



## Your final outcome:
- You will build your first *dynamic* **web application** combining the all of the CS tools you learned so far!


## Project Plan:
In this challenge, you will design and build a **full scale web application!** It can be about:  
- A Status Quo
- Something you're passionate about.
- A game you’ve been wanting to create.
- Favorite product, brand, person...etc.


## Requirements:
Final Outcome:
- User Interactivity
- Uses Flask
- Databases implemented. (Try to use CRUD)

### Bonus:
- Use an API
- Deployed on Heroku * *(We will help you deploy it!)*  

### Should be submitted with: 
- Storyboard & Wireframe
- Planning Document *(if any)*  


## Why should you care?
You learned about Front-end (HTML, CSS and JS) and Back-end (Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy). Now it’s time to put all of this knowledge combined together to the test!  
The best way to practice and solidify all of these new concept in programming is to actually implement it, so this project gives you a chance to make practical use of what you’ve learned.
This is your chance to show us what you’re passionate about using CS only, you can show off your skills and still focus on your website’s topic using your creativity!  


## Brainstorming:  
1. Brainstorm a topic the website revolves around and a name for the website.
- Can be on paper & pen or a tool of your choice. *Make sure to save your documentation somewhere safe as you'll have to submit it!*

### Project Samples: (To get your brain running)

## Storyboarding & Wireframing:
1. Draw the storyboards and wireframe of your different pages!  
- Can be on paper & pen or a wireframing tool of your choice (such as [NinjaMock](https://ninjamock.com/)).
- For getting a color scheme, here's a [useful website](https://coolors.co/)  
- Wireframe example:
