## Motivation:
You learned about Front-end(HTML, CSS and JS) and Back-end (Python, Flask and SQLAlchemy). Now it’s time to put all of this knowledge combined together to the test.
The best way to practice and solidify all of these new concept in programming is to actually implement it, so this project gives you a chance to make practical use of what you’ve learned.
This is your chance to show us what you’re passionate about using CS only, you can show off your skills and still focus on your website’s topic using your creativity!
